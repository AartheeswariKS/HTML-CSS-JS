<ul>
<li>The rook is the second most powerful piece in chess! It is a long-range piece and is notorious for delivering back-rank checkmates!</li>
<li>When a game begins, each side starts with two rooks.</li>
<li>The rooks begin the game in the corners of the chessboard: White's rooks start the game on a1 and h1, while Black's rooks are located on a8 and h8.</li>
<li>The rook is considered a major piece (like the queen) and is worth five points.</li>
<li>As mentioned, the rook is the second most powerful piece (behind the queen).</li>
<li>The rook can move forward, backward or sideways, but cannot move diagonally (like a queen or a bishop).</li>
<li>The rook can move up or down vertically on any file.</li>
<li>In the following diagram, you can see the rook's potential moves highlighted on the e-file.</li>
<li>It is considerably more valuable than a pawn (one point), a knight (three points), and a bishop (also three points) is but less valuable than a queen (nine points).</li>
<li>A rook can move any number of squares along a rank or file, but cannot leap over other pieces.</li>
<li>Along with the king, a rook is involved during the king's castling move.</li>
</ul>
